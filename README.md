## Get Access to starting materials

Lessons:
Navigate to the PY101 course materials: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FcXSrAl7eRY-WcO7_9s9pDFNTeXXWLo3. Request access, and I will add you.

Homework Assignments:
[Solvestack Portal](https://portal.solvestack.com/course/view.php?id=2)

Once I have your email address, first and last name, I will make a student account for you. Once logged in, you should be able to click on PY101 - Intro to Python and click ‚ÄúEnrol me in this course‚Äù. I think ‚ÄúEnrol‚Äù is how they spell it in Britain.

/# TODO: I will have to hunt down the Timezone and Language settings lol.
